<h1>CUBS OF THE WOLF</h1>

<h2>BY RAYMOND F. JONES</h2>

<p class="tease"><big>It may be</big> that there is a weapon that, from the<br />
viewpoint of the one it's used on, is worse than<br />
lethal. You might say that death multiplies you by<br />
zero; what would multiplication by minus one do?</p>

<p class="illo">Illustrated by Rogers</p>


<p>In the spring the cherry blossoms
are heavy in the air over the campus
of Solarian Institute of Science and
Humanities. On a small slope that
rims the park area, Cameron Wilder
lay on his back squinting through the
cloud of pink-white petals to the sky
beyond. Beside him, Joyce Farquhar
drew her jacket closer with an irritated
gesture. It was still too cold to
be sitting on the grass, but Cameron
didn't seem to notice it&mdash;or anything
else, Joyce thought.</p>

<p>"If you don't submit a subject for
your thesis now," she said, "you'll
take another full six months getting
your doctorate. Sometimes I think you
don't really want it!"</p>

<p>Cameron stirred. He shifted his
squinting gaze from the sky to Joyce
and finally sat up. But he was staring
ahead through the trees again as he
took his pipe from his pocket and
began filling it slowly.</p>

<p>"I <i>don't</i> want it if it's not going
to mean anything after I get it," he
said belligerently. "I'm not going to
do an investigation of some silly
subject like The Transience of Venusian
Immigrants in Relation to the
Martian Polar Ice Cap Cycle. Solarian
sociologists are the butt of enough
ridicule now. Do something like that
and for the rest of your life you get
knocking of the knees whenever anybody
inquires about the specialty you
worked in and threatens to read your
thesis."</p>

<p>"Nobody's asking you to do anything
you don't want to. But <i>you</i>
picked the field of sociology to work
in. Now I don't see why you have
to act such a purist that it takes
months to find a research project for
your degree. Pick something&mdash;anything!&mdash;I
don't care what it is. But
if you don't get a degree and an
appointment out of the next session
I don't think we'll ever get married&mdash;not
ever."</p>

<p>Cameron removed his pipe from
his mouth with a precise grip and
considered it intently as it cupped in
his hands. "I'm glad you mentioned
marriage," he said. "I was just about
to speak of it myself."</p>

<p>"Well, don't!" said Joyce. "After
three years&mdash;Three years!"</p>

<p>He turned to face her and smiled
for the first time. He liked to lead
her along occasionally just to watch
her explode, but he was not always
sure when he had gone too far. Joyce
had a mind like a snapping, random
matching calculator while he operated
more on a slow, carefully shaping
analogue basis, knowing things were
never quite what they seemed but
trying to get as close an approximation
of the true picture as possible.</p>

<p>"Will you marry me now?" he
said.</p>

<p>The question did not seem to startle
her. "No degree, no appointment&mdash;and
no chance of getting one&mdash;we
couldn't even get a license. I hope
you aren't suggesting we try to get
along without one, or on a forgery!"</p>

<p>Cameron shook his head. "No,
darling, this is a perfectly bona fide
proposal, complete with license, appointment,
the works&mdash;what do you
say?"</p>

<p>"I say this spring sun is too much
for you." She touched the dark mass
of his hair, warmed by the sun's rays,
and put her head on his shoulder.
She started to cry. "Don't tease me
like that, Cameron. It seems like
we've been waiting forever&mdash;and
there's still forever ahead of us. You
can't do anything you want to&mdash;"</p>

<p>Cameron put his arms about her,
not caring if the whole Institute faculty
leaned out the windows to watch.
"That's why you should appreciate
being about to marry such a resourceful
fellow," he said more gently. And
now he dropped all banter. "I've been
thinking about how long it's been,
too. That's why I decided to try to
kill a couple of sparrows with one
pebble."</p>

<p>Joyce sat up. "You aren't serious&mdash;?"</p>

<p>Cameron sucked on his pipe once
more. "Ever hear of the Markovian
Nucleus?" he said thoughtfully.</p>

<p>Joyce slowly nodded her head.
"Oh, I think I've heard the name
mentioned," she murmured, "but
nothing more than that."</p>

<p>"I've asked for that as my research
project."</p>

<p>"But that's clear out of the galaxy&mdash;in
Transpace!"</p>

<p>"Yes, and obviously out of bounds
for the ordinary graduate researcher.
But because of the scholarship record
I've been able to rack up here I took
a chance on applying to the Corning
Foundation for a grant. And they
decided to take a chance on me after
considerable and not entirely painless
investigation. That's why you were
followed around like a suspected Disloyalist
for a month. My application
included a provision for you to go
along as my wife. Professor Fothergill
notified me this morning that the
grant had been awarded."</p>

<p>"Cam&mdash;" Joyce's voice was brittle
now. "You aren't fooling me?"</p>

<p>He gathered her in his arms again.
"You think I would fool about something
like that, darling? In a week
you'll be Mrs. C. Wilder, and as
soon as school is out, on your way to
the Markovian Nucleus. And besides,
it took me almost as much work preparing
the research prospectus as the
average guy spends on his whole
project!"</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>Sometimes Joyce Farquhar wished
Cameron were a good deal different
than he was. But then he wouldn't
have been Cameron, and she wouldn't
want to marry him, she supposed.
And somehow, while he fell behind
on the mid-stretch, he always managed
to come in at the end with the
rest of the field. Or just a little bit
ahead of it.</p>

<p>Or a good deal ahead of it. As
now. It took her a few moments to
realize the magnitude of the coup
he had actually pulled off. For weeks
she had been depressed because he
refused to use some trivial, breeze
research to get his degree. He could
have started it as much as a year ago,
and they could have been married
now if he'd set himself up a real
cinch.</p>

<p>But now they were getting married
anyway&mdash;and Cameron was getting
the kind of research deal that would
satisfy his frantic desire for integrity
in a world where it counted for little,
and his wish to contribute something
genuine to the sociological understanding
of sentient creatures.</p>

<p>Their marriage, as was customary,
would be a cut and dried affair. A
call to the license bureau, receipt of
formal sanction in the mail&mdash;she supposed
Cameron had already made application&mdash;and
a little party with a
few of their closest friends on the
campus. She wished she had lived in
the days when getting married was
much easier to do, and something to
make a fuss about.</p>

<p>She stirred and sat up, loosening
the jacket as the sun came from behind
a puff of cloud. "You could
have told me about this a long time
ago, couldn't you?" she said accusingly.</p>

<p>Cameron nodded. "I could have.
But I didn't want to get false hopes
aroused. I didn't have much hope
the deal would actually go through,
myself. I think Fothergill is pretty
much responsible for it."</p>

<p>"Transpace&mdash;" Joyce said dreamily.
"Tell me about the Markovian Nucleus.
Why is it important enough
for a big research study, anyway?"</p>

<p>"It's a case of a leopard who
changed his spots," said Cameron.
"And nobody knows how or why.
The full title of the project is A
Study of the Metamorphosis of the
Markovian Nucleus."</p>

<p>"What happened? How are they
any different from the way they used
to be?"</p>

<p>"A hundred and fifty years ago the
Markovians were the meanest, nastiest,
orneriest specimens in the entire
Council of Galactic Associates. The
groups of worlds in one corner of
their galaxy, which make up the
Nucleus, controlled a military force
that outweighed anything the Council
could possibly bring to bear against
them.</p>

<p>"With complete disregard of any
scheme of interplanetary rules or
order they harassed and attacked
peaceful shipping and inoffensive cultures
throughout a wide territory.
They were something demanding the
Council's military action. But the
Council lacked the strength.</p>

<p>"For years the Council dragged on,
debating and threatening ineffectively.
But nothing was ever done. And
then, so gradually it was hardly noticed,
the harassments began to die
down. The warlike posturing was
abandoned by the Markovians. Within
a period of about seventy or eighty
years there was a complete about-face.
They wound up as good Indians,
peaceful, co&ouml;perative and intelligent
members of the Council."</p>

<p>"Didn't anybody ever find out
why?" asked Joyce.</p>

<p>"No. Nobody <i>wanted</i> to find out.
In the early years the worlds of the
Council were hiding behind their
collective hands hoping with all their
might that the threat might go away
if they kept their eyes closed long
enough. And by some miracle of all
miracles, when they parted their fingers
for a scared glimpse, the threat
<i>had</i> disappeared.</p>

<p>"When they could breathe a little
more easily it seemed a foolish thing
to bring out this old skeleton from
the closet again, so a perpetual state
of hush was established. Finally, the
whole thing was practically forgotten
except for a short paragraph in an
occasional history text. But no politician
or historian has ever dared publicly
to question the mysterious why
of the Markovian's about-face."</p>

<p>"Sociologists should have done it
long ago," said Joyce.</p>

<p>"There was always the political
pressure, of course," said Cameron.
"But the real reason was simply our
preoccupation with making bibliographies
of each others' papers. It's
going to take a lot of leg work, something
in which our formal courses
don't give us any basic training. Fothergill
understands that&mdash;it's why he
pushed me so hard with the Foundation.
And Riley up there is capable of
seeing it, too.</p>

<p>"I showed him that here was a
complex of at least a hundred and
ten major planets, inhabited by a
fairly homogenous, civilized people,
speaking from a technological point
of view at least. And almost overnight
some force changed the entire
cultural posture. I made him see that
identification of that force is of no
small interest to us right now. If it
operated once, it could operate again&mdash;and
would its results be as happy
a second time?</p>

<p>"Riley got the Foundation to kick
through enough for you and me to
make a start. A preliminary survey is
about all it will amount to, actually,
but if we show evidence of something
tangible I'll get my degree, you'll get
your basic certification&mdash;and we'll
both return in charge of a full-scale
inquiry with a staff big enough to
really dig into things next year.</p>

<p>"Now&mdash;about this matter of marriage
which you didn't want me to
speak of&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Keep talking, Cam&mdash;you're doing
wonderfully!"</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>They got married at once, even
though there were several weeks of
school which had to be finished before
they could leave. Among their
friends on the campus there were a
good many whispered remarks about
the insanity of Joyce and Cameron in
planning such a fantastic excursion,
but Joyce was certain there was as
much envy as criticism in the eyes of
her associates. It might be true when
they asserted that every conceivable
sociological factor or combination of
factors could be found and analyzed
right here in the Solar System, but a
husband who could finagle a way to
combine a honeymoon trip halfway
across space with his graduate research
thesis was a rare specimen.
Joyce played her advantage for all it
was worth.</p>

<p>Two weeks before departure time,
however, Cameron was called to the
office of Professor Fothergill. As he
entered he found a third man present,
wearing a uniform he recognized at
once as belonging to the Council
Secretariat.</p>

<p>"I'll wait outside," he said abruptly
as Fothergill turned. "I got your
message and came right over. I didn't
know&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Sit down," said Fothergill. "Cameron,
this is Mr. Ebbing, whose position
you no doubt recognize. Mr.
Ebbing, Mr. Wilder."</p>

<p>The men shook hands and took
seats across from each other. Fothergill
sat between them at the polished
table. "The Council, it seems, has
developed an interest in your proposed
research among the Markovians,"
he said. "I'll let Mr. Ebbing
tell you about it."</p>

<p>Cameron felt a sinking anticipation
within him as he turned to the secretary.
Surely the Council wasn't going
to actively oppose the investigation
after so long a time!</p>

<p>The secretary coughed and shuffled
the papers he drew from his case.
"It's not actually the Council's interest,"
he said, and Cameron was immediately
relieved. "But I have been
asked by the Markovian Nucleus,
through their representative, to suggest
that they would like to save you
the long and unnecessary trip. He
offers to co-operate to the fullest
degree by causing all necessary materials
to be transferred to your site
of study right here. He feels that this
is the least they can do since so much
interest appears to exist in the Nucleus."</p>

<p>Cameron stared at the secretary,
trying to discern what the man's own
attitude might be, but Ebbing gave
no sign of playing it any way but
straight.</p>

<p>"It sounds like a polite invitation
to stay home and mind our own business,"
said Cameron finally. "They
don't want company."</p>

<p>The secretary's expression changed
to acknowledgment of the correct appraisal.
"They don't want any investigation
into the Metamorphosis
of the Markovian Nucleus. There is
no such thing. It is entirely a myth."</p>

<p>"Says the Markovians&mdash;!"</p>

<p>Ebbing nodded. "Says the Markovians.
Other worlds, both within and
without the Council have persisted in
spreading tales and rumors about the
Markovians for a long time. They
don't like it. They are willing to co-operate
in having a correct analysis
of their culture published, but they
don't want any more of these infamous
rumors circulated."</p>

<p>"Then why aren't they willing to
promote such an investigation? This
would be their big chance&mdash;if their
ridiculous position were true!"</p>

<p>"They <i>are</i> willing. I've told you
the representative has offered to send
you all needed material showing the
status of their culture."</p>

<p>Cameron looked at the secretary
for a long time before speaking
again. "What's your position?" he
asked finally. "Are we being ordered
off the investigation?"</p>

<p>"The Markovian representative
doesn't want to go to quite that
extreme. He knows that, too, would
react unfavorably towards his people.
Here's his point: So far, he's blocked
news of your proposed research getting
to his home worlds. But he
knows that if you do carry it out in
the manner you propose it is going
to make a lot of the home folks
mighty unhappy and they'll demand
to know why he didn't stop it. So
he's trying to satisfy both sides at
once."</p>

<p>"Why will the people in the Nucleus
be made unhappy by our coming?"</p>

<p>"Because you'll go there trying to
track down the basis for the rumors
that defame the Markovian character.
You'll bring forcibly to their attention
the fact that the rest of the
Universe believes the Markovians
are basically a bunch of pirates."</p>

<p>"And the Markovians don't like to
hear these things?"</p>

<p>"Definitely not."</p>

<p>"So you tell me the research is not
being forbidden, but that the Markovians
won't like it. Suppose I tell you,
then, I'm not going to give up short
of an order from the Council itself.
But I am willing to camouflage the
investigation if necessary. I'll make
no open mention of what outside
opinion says of the Markovians. I'll
simply make a study of their history
and character as it becomes available
to me."</p>

<p>Ebbing nodded slowly, his eyes
fixed on Cameron's face. "I would
say that would be eminently satisfactory,"
he said. "I will inform the
representative of your decision."</p>

<p>Then his face became more severe.
"The Council will be pleased to learn
of your willingness to be discreet. I
wonder if you understand that the
Foundation came to us upon receipt
of your application, for official clearance
of the project. It coincided quite
fortuitously with the plans of the
Council itself. For a long time we
have been concerned with the lack of
information regarding the Markovian
situation and have been at a loss as
to how to improve our situation.</p>

<p>"Your proposed investigation
seemed the answer, but we anticipated
the Markovian objection and
had to make certain you would co-operate
to his satisfaction. I believe
this will do it."</p>

<p>"Why is the Council concerned?"
said Cameron. "Have the Markovians
changed their attitude in any way?"</p>

<p>"No&mdash;but the rest of us remember,
even though we don't speak of
it, that the Nucleus was never punished
for its depredations, nor was it
ever defeated. Its strength is as great
as ever in proportion to the other
Council worlds.</p>

<p>"What are the chances and potentialities
of the Nucleus worlds ever
again becoming the marauders they
once were? That is the question
which we feel must be answered.
Without knowing, we are sitting on
a powder keg in which the fuse may
or may not be lighted. Will you bring
us back the answer we need?"</p>

<p>Cameron felt a sudden grimness
which had not been present before.
"I'll do all I can," he said soberly.
"If the information is there I'll bring
it back."</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>After the secretary had gone and
Fothergill turned from the door to
rejoin him Cameron sat in faintly
shocked consideration of the Council's
unexpected support. It took his
research out of the realm of the purely
sociological and projected it into
politics and diplomacy. He was
pleased by their confidence, but not
cheered by the added responsibility.</p>

<p>"That's a lucky break," said Fothergill
enthusiastically, "and I'm beginning
to suspect you may be rather
badly in need of all the breaks you
can get once you land among the
Markovians. Don't forget for a single
minute that you are dealing with
the sons and grandsons of genuine
pirates."</p>

<p>The professor sat down again.
"There's one other little item of interest
I turned up the other day. You
should know about it before you
leave. The Markovian Nucleus is
somewhat of a hotbed of Ids."</p>

<p>"Ids&mdash;you mean the Idealists&mdash;?"</p>

<p>Fothergill nodded. "Know anything
about them?"</p>

<p>"Not much, except that they are
a sort of parasitic group, living usually
in a servant relationship to other
races on terran-type worlds. As I
recall, even they claim that they do
not know the planet or even the
galaxy of their origin, because they
have been wanderers for so many
generations among alien races. Perhaps
it would be a good idea to
make a study of them, too&mdash;I don't
know that a thorough one has ever
been made."</p>

<p>"That's what I wanted to warn
you about," said Fothergill, smiling.
"Stick to one subject at a time. The
Ids <i>would</i> make a nice research
project in themselves, and maybe you
can get around to it eventually. But
leave them alone for the present and
don't become distracted from your
basic project among the Markovians.
The policy of the Corning Foundation
is to demand something very
definite in return for the money they
lay on the line. You won't get to go
back next year unless you produce.
That's why I don't want you to get
sidetracked in any way."</p>


<p class="theend">II</p>

<p>Cameron admitted to himself that
he was getting more edgy as the day
of departure approached, but he tried
to keep Joyce from seeing it. He
was worried about the possible development
of further opposition now
that the Markovian had expressed
his displeasure, and he was worried
about their reception once they reached
the Nucleus. He wondered why
they had not seen in advance that it
would be an obvious blunder to let
the Markovians be aware of their
real purpose. It didn't even require a
pirate ancestry to make groups unappreciative
about resurrection of
their family skeletons.</p>

<p>But no other hindrance appeared,
and on the evening before their
departure Fothergill called that word
had been received from Ebbing stating
the Markovian representative had
approved the visit now that Cameron
had expressed a change in his objectives.
Their coming had been announced
to the Markovian people
and the way prepared for an official
welcome.</p>

<p>Cameron was pleased by the
change of attitude. He was hit for
the first time, however, by the full
force of the fact that he was taking
his bride to a pirate center which the
Council had never overthrown and
which was active only moments ago,
culturally speaking.</p>

<p>If any kind of trouble should
develop the Council would be almost
impotent in offering them assistance.
On the face of it, there was no reason
to expect trouble. But the peculiarly
oblique opposition of the Markovian
delegate in the Council continued to
make him uneasy.</p>

<p>His tentative suggestion that he
would feel better if he knew she
were safe on Earth brought a blistering
response from Joyce, which left
him with no doubts about carrying
out his original plans.</p>

<p>And then, as the last of their packing
was completed and they were
ready to call it a day, the phone
buzzed. Cameron hesitated, determined
to let it go unanswered, then
punched the button irritably on audio
only.</p>

<p>Instead of the caller, he heard the
voice of the operator. "One moment
please. Interstellar, Transpace, printed.
Please connect visio."</p>

<p>It was like a shock, he thought
afterwards. There was no one he
knew who could be making such a
call to him. But automatically he did
as directed. Joyce had come up and
was peering over his shoulder now.
The screen fluttered for a moment
with polychrome colors and cleared.
The message, printed for English
translation, stood out sharply. Joyce
and Cameron exclaimed simultaneously
at the titling. It was from Premier
Jargla, Executive Head of the
Markovian Government.</p>

<p>"To Wilder, Cameron and Joyce,"
it read, "greetings and appreciation
for your proposed visit to the Markovian
Nucleus for study of our history
and customs. We have not been before
so honored. We feel, however,
that it is an imposition on your Foundation
and on you personally to require
that you make the long journey
to the Nucleus for this purpose
alone. While we would be honored
to entertain you&mdash;"</p>

<p>It was the same proposition as
Ebbing had reported the delegate
offered. Only this time it was from
the head of the Markovian government
himself.</p>

<p>They sat up nearly all the rest of
the night considering this new development.
"Maybe you shouldn't go,
after all," said Joyce once. "Maybe
this is something that needs bigger
handling than we can possibly give
it."</p>

<p>Cameron shook his head. "<i>I've</i> got
to go. They haven't closed the door
and said we can't come. If I backed
out before they did, I'd be
known the rest of my life as the guy
who was <i>going</i> to crack the Markovian
problem. But I'd much rather
you&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No! If you're going, so am I."</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>They consulted again with Fothergill
and finally drafted as polite a
reply as possible, explaining they
were newly married, desired to make
the trip a honeymoon excursion primarily
and conduct an investigation
into Markovian culture to prevent the
waste of the wonderful opportunity
their visit would afford them.</p>

<p>An hour before takeoff a polite
acknowledgment came back from the
Nucleus assuring them a warm welcome
and congratulating them on
their marriage. They went at once to
the spaceport and took over their
stateroom. "Before anything else
happens to try to pull us off this
investigation," Cameron said.</p>

<p>The trip would be a long one, involving
more than two months subjective
time, because no express runs
moved any distance at all in the direction
of the Nucleus. It was necessary
to transfer three times, with days
of waiting between ships on planets
whose surface conditions permitted
exploration only in cumbersome suits
that could not be worn for more
than short periods. Most of the waiting
time was spent in the visitors'
chambers at the landing fields.</p>

<p>These seemed to grow progressively
worse. The last one could not
maintain a gravity below 2G, and
the minimum temperature available
was 104 degrees. There was a three-day
wait here and Joyce spent most
of it lying on the bed, under the
breeze of a fan which seemed to have
required a special dispensation of the
governing body to obtain.</p>

</div>

<p>Cameron, however, was unwilling
to spend his time this way in spite of
the discomfort imposed by any kind
of activity. Humidity was a physical
factor which seemed to have gone
undiscovered by the inhabitants of
the planet they were on. He was
sure it was constantly maintained
within a fractional per cent of one
hundred as he donned a clean pair of
trunks and staggered miserably along
the corridor toward a window that
gave a limited view of the city about
them.</p>

<p>That was when he discovered that
they were to be accompanied on the
remainder of the journey by a Markovian
citizen and his Id servant.</p>

<p>The visitors' chamber in which
these semi-terran conditions were
supplied consisted of only three
suites. The other two had been empty
when Cameron and Joyce arrived
the night before. Now a Markovian
Id occupied a seat by the window.
He glanced up with warm friendliness
and invited Cameron to join
him.</p>

<p>Cameron hesitated, undecided for
a moment whether to return to his
suite for the portable semantic translator
used in his profession at times
like this. He always felt there was
something decidedly unprofessional
about resorting to their use and had
spent many hours trying to master
Markovian before leaving. He understood
the Id well enough and decided
to see if he could get along without
the translator.</p>

<p>"Thanks," he said, taking a seat.
"I don't suppose there's much else
to do except look at the scenery
here."</p>

<p>The Id showed obvious surprise
that Cameron spoke the language
without use of an instrument. His
look of pleasure increased. "It is not
often we find one of your race who
has taken the trouble to make himself
communicable with us. You must be
expecting to make a long stay?"</p>

<p>Cameron's sense of caution returned
as he remembered the previous
results of indiscreet announcement
of his purpose. He wiped the stream
of sweat from his face and neck and
took a good look at the Id.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>The Idealists were of an anthropomorphic
race, dark-skinned like
the terran Indian. Very few of them
had ever appeared on Earth, however,
and this was actually Cameron's
first view of one in the flesh. He
knew something of their reputation
and characteristics from very brief
study at the Institute&mdash;but no one
really knew very much of the Ids
as far as Earthmen were concerned.
The warning of Fothergill to keep
to the main line of his research sank
to the bottom of his mind as he
leaned toward the stranger with a
fresh sense of excitement inside him.</p>

<p>"I have never felt you could understand
another man unless you
spoke his language," he said in his
not too stumbling Markovian.</p>

<p>The Id, like himself, was dressed
in the briefest of garments and perspiration
poured from the dark skin
as he nodded. "You speak sounder
wisdom than one usually meets in a
stranger," he said. "May I introduce
myself: Sal Karone, servant of the
Master Dalls Ret Marthasa?"</p>

<p>Cameron introduced himself and
cautiously explained that he and
Joyce were on their honeymoon, but
had a side interest in the history
and customs of the Markovian Nucleus.
"My people know so little
about you," he said, "it would be a
great privilege to be able to take
back information that would increase
our mutual understanding."</p>

<p>"All that the Idealists have belongs
to every man and every race," said
Sal Karone solemnly. "What we can
give you may be had for the asking.
But I would give you a word of
warning about my Masters."</p>

<p>Cameron felt the flesh of his back
tingle with sudden chill as the eyes
of the Id turned full upon him.</p>

<p>"Do not try to find out the hidden
things of the Masters. That is what
you have come for, is it not, Cameron
Wilder? That is why you have
taken so much trouble to learn the
language which we speak. I say do
not inquire of the things about which
they do not wish to speak. My Masters
are a people who cannot yet be
understood by the men of other
worlds. In time there will be understanding,
but that time is not yet.
You will only bring disaster and disappointment
upon us and yourselves
by attempting to hasten that time."</p>

<p>"I assure you I have no intention
of prying," said Cameron haltingly.
He fumbled for the right Markovian
words. "You have misunderstood&mdash;We
come only in friendship and with
no intention of disturbing&mdash;"</p>

<p>The Id nodded sagely. "So many
crises are originated by good intentions.
But I am sure that now you
understand the feelings of my Masters
in these things that you will be
concerned only with your own enjoyment
while in the Nucleus. And do
come to the centers of the Idealists,
for there is much we can show you,
and our willingness has no limits."</p>

<p>For a moment it was impossible
for Cameron to remember that he
was dealing with a mere servant of
the Markovians. The Id's words were
so incisive and his manner so commanding
that it seemed he must be
speaking in his own right.</p>

<p>And then his manner changed. His
boldness vanished and he spoke obsequiously.
"You will forgive me,"
he said, "but this is a matter concerning
which there is much feeling."</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>Cameron Wilder was more than
willing to agree with this sentiment.
As he returned to his own quarters
he debated telling Joyce of his encounter
with the Id, deciding finally
that he'd have to mention it since
they'd all be traveling together, but
omitting the Id's repetition of the
previous warnings.</p>

<p>He did not meet the Markovian,
nor did he encounter the Id again
in the waiting quarters. It was not
until they had embarked on the last
leg of the journey and had been
aboard the vessel for half a day that
they met a second time.</p>

<p>The ship was not a Markovian or
a terran-type vessel of any kind. Another
week's wait would have been
required for one of those. As it was,
their quarters were not too uncomfortable
although very limited. The
bulk of the vessel was designed for
crew and passengers very much unlike
Terran or Markovian, and only
a few suites were provided for accommodation
of such races.</p>

<p>This threw the travelers to the
Nucleus in close association again.
Their suites opened to a common
lounge deck and when Cameron and
Joyce went out they found Sal Karone
and the Markovian, Marthasa,
already there.</p>

<p>The Id was on his feet instantly.
With a sharp bow he introduced the
newcomers to his Master. Dells
Marthasa stood and extended a hand
with a smile. "I believe that is your
greeting on Earth, is it not?" he said.</p>

<p>"You must be familiar with our
home world," said Cameron, returning
the handshake.</p>

<p>"Only a little, through my studies,"
said the Markovian. "Enough to
make me want to hear much more.
Please join us. Since my <i>sargh</i> told
me we would be traveling together I
have looked forward to your company."</p>

<p>The term, <i>sargh</i>, as Cameron
learned shortly was applied to all
Ids attached to Markovians. It had a
connotation somewhere between servant
and companion. Sal Karone remained
in the background, but there
was no servility in his manner. His
eyes remained respectfully&mdash;almost
fondly; that was the right word,
Cameron thought curiously&mdash;on
Marthasa.</p>

<p>While the Id was slender in build,
the Markovian was taller and bulkier.
His complexion was also dark, but
not quite so much so as the Id's. He
was dressed in loose, highly colored
attire that gave Cameron an impression
of an Oriental potentate of his
own world.</p>

<p>But somehow there was a quality
in Marthasa's manner that was jarring.
It would have been less so if
the Markovian had been less anthropomorphic
in form and feature, but
Cameron found it difficult to think
of him as anything but a fellow man.</p>

<p>A man of arrogance and ill manners,
and completely unaware that
he was so.</p>

<p>It was apparent in his gestures and
in the negligence with which he
leaned back and surveyed his companions.
"You'll be surprised when
you see the Nucleus," he said. "We
sometimes hear of rumors circulated
among Council worlds that Markovian
culture is rather backward."</p>

<p>"I've never heard anything of that
kind," said Cameron. "In fact we've
heard almost nothing at all of the
Nucleus. That's why we decided to
come."</p>

<p>"I'm sure we can make you glad
you did. Don't you think so,
Karone?"</p>

<p>The face of the Id was very sober
as he nodded solemnly and said,
"Indeed, Master." His burning eyes
were boring directly into Cameron's
own.</p>

<p>"I want to hear about your people,
about Earth," said Marthasa.
"Tell me what you would like to see
and do while you're in the Nucleus."</p>

<p>While Joyce answered, explaining
they hardly knew what there was to
be seen, Cameron's attention was
fixed by the problem of the strange
relationship between the two men&mdash;the
two races. In the face of the
Id there seemed a serenity, a dignity
that the Markovian would never
know. Why had the Ids failed to lift
themselves out of servility to a state
of independence, he wondered?</p>

<p>Joyce explained the story about
their honeymoon trip and built their
interest in Markovian culture as casual
indeed. As she went on, Marthasa
seemed to be struck by a sudden
thought.</p>

<p>"I insist that you make your headquarters
with me during your stay,"
he said. "I can see that you learn
everything possible about the Nucleus
while you are here. My son is
a Chief Historian at our largest research
library and my daughter has
the post of Assistant Curator at our
Museum of Science and Culture. You
will never have a better opportunity
to examine the culture of the Nucleus!"</p>

<p>Cameron winced inwardly at the
thought of Marthasa's companionship
during their whole stay, and yet
the Markovian's statement might be
perfectly true&mdash;there would be no
better opportunity to make their
study.</p>

<p>"We have an official note of welcome
from your Executive Head,
Premier Jargla," he said. "While we
would be very happy to accept your
invitation, it may be that he has
different plans for our reception."</p>

<p>Marthasa waved a hand. "I shall
arrange for my appointment as your
official host. Consider it agreed
upon!"</p>

<p>It was agreed. But Joyce was not
as optimistic as Cameron in regarding
it an aid to their study. "If they
have a general aversion to talking
about their pirate ancestry, Marthasa
is just the boy to put us off the
track," she said. "If he gets a clue
to what we really want to know, he'll
keep us busy looking at everything
else until we give up and go home."</p>

<p>Cameron leaned back in the deep
chair with his hands behind his head.
"It's not too hard to imagine
Marthasa's great-great-grandfather
running down vessels in space and
pillaging helpless cities on other
planets. The veneer of civilization on
him doesn't look very thick."</p>

<p>"It's not hard to imagine Marthasa
doing it," said Joyce. "A scimitar
between his teeth would be completely
in character!"</p>

<p>"If all goes well, you will probably
see just that&mdash;figuratively speaking,
of course. Where a cultural shift
has been so great as this one you are
certain to see evidence of both levels
in conflict with one another. It's like
a geologic fault line. Once we learn
enough about the current mores the
anomalies will stand out in full
view. That's what we want to watch
for."</p>

<p>"One thing that's out of character
right now is his offer of assistance
through his son, the Chief Historian,"
said Joyce. "That doesn't check
with the previous invitations to stay
home. Once they let us have access
to their historical records we'll have
them pegged."</p>

<p>"We haven't got it yet," said Cameron.
"We can't be sure just what
they'll let us see. But for my money
I'd just as soon tackle the question of
the Ids. Sal Karone is twice the man
Marthasa is, yet he acts like he has
no will of his own when the Markovian
is around."</p>

<p>"The Roman-slave relationship,"
said Joyce. "The Markovians probably
conquered a large community of
the Ids in their pirate days and
brought them here as slaves. And I'll
bet they are very much aware that
the Ids are the better men. Marthasa
knows it. That's why he has to put
on a show in front of Sal Karone.
He's the old Roman merchant struggling
to keep up his conviction of
superiority before the Greek scholar
slave."</p>

<p>"The Ids aren't supposed to be
slaves. According to the little that's
known they are completely free. I'm
going to get Marthasa's version of it,
anyway. Fothergill and the Foundation
can't object to that much investigation
of the Ids."</p>

<p>He found the Markovian completely
willing to talk about his
<i>sargh</i>. On the last day of the voyage
they managed to be alone for a time
without the presence of Sal Karone.</p>

<p>Marthasa shook his head in answer
to Cameron's question. "No, the
<i>sargh</i> is not a slave&mdash;not in the sense
I believe you mean it. None of the
Ids are. It's a matter of religion with
them to be attached to us the way
they are. They have some incomprehensible
belief that their existence
is of no value unless they are serving
their fellow beings. Since that means
<i>all</i> of them they can't be satisfied by
serving each other so they have to
pick on some other race.</p>

<p>"I don't recall when they first
showed up in the Nucleus, but it's
been many generations ago. There've
been Ids in my family for a half
dozen generations anyway."</p>

<p>"They had space flight, so they
came under their own power?" Cameron
asked incredulously.</p>

<p>"No. Nothing like that. You can't
imagine <i>them</i> building spaceships can
you? They migrated at first as lowest-class
passengers on the commercial
lines. Nobody knows just where they
came from. They don't even know
their home worlds. At first we tried
to persuade them to go somewhere
else, but then we saw how useful
they could be with their fanatic belief
in servitude.</p>

<p>"At present there is probably no
family in the Nucleus that doesn't
have at least one Id <i>sargh</i>. Many of
us have one for every member of the
family." Marthasa paused. The tone
of his voice changed. "When you've
had one almost all your life as I've
had Sal Karone it&mdash;well, it does
something to you."</p>

<p>"What do you mean?" Cameron
asked cautiously.</p>

<p>"Consider the situation from Sal
Karone's point of view. He has no
life whatever that is his own. His
whole purpose is to give me companionship
and satisfy my requirements.
And I don't have to force
him in any way. It's all voluntary.
He's free to leave, even, any time he
wants to. But I'm certain he never
will."</p>

<p>"Why do you feel so sure of
this?"</p>

<p>"It's hard to explain. I feel as if
I've become so much a part of him
that he couldn't survive alone any
more. He's the one who's made it
that way, not me. I have become indispensable
to his existence. That's
the way I explain it to myself. Most
of my friends agree that this is about
right."</p>

<p>"It's rather difficult to understand
a relationship like that&mdash;unless you
put it in terms I am familiar with on
Earth."</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;? What would it be called
among your people?"</p>

<p>"When a man so devotes his life
to another we say it is because of
love."</p>

<p>Marthasa considered the word.
"You would be wrong," he said. "It
is just that in some way we have
become indispensable to the Ids.
They're parasites, if you want to put
it that way. But they provide us a
relationship we can get nowhere else,
and that does us a great deal of good.
That's what I meant when I said it
does something to us."</p>

<p>"What about the Id's own culture?
Haven't they any community ties
among themselves, or do they ignore
their own kind?"</p>

<p>"We've never investigated very
much. I suppose some of our scholars
know the answer to that, but the rest
of us don't. The Ids have communities,
all right. Not all of them are
in service as <i>sarghs</i> at one time. They
have little groups and communities
on the outskirts of our cities, but
they don't amount to much. As a race
they are simply inferior. They don't
have the capacity for a strong culture
of their own, so they can't exist
independently and build a social
structure like other people. It's this
religion of theirs that does it. They
won't let go of it, and as long as they
hang onto it they can't stand on their
own feet. But you don't need to
feel sorry for them. We treat them
all right."</p>

<p>"Of course&mdash;didn't mean to imply
anything else," said Cameron. "Do
you know if there are other Id groups
serving in other galaxies?"</p>

<p>"Must be thousands of them altogether.
Out beyond the Nucleus,
away from your galaxy, you can't
find a planet anywhere that isn't
using the Ids. It's a wonderful setup.
The Ids get what they want, and we
get <i>sarghs</i> with nothing like the slave
relationship you had in mind. With
slaves there's rebellion, constant need
of watchfulness, and no genuine
companionship. A <i>sargh</i> is different.
He can be a man's friend."</p>


<p class="theend">III</p>

<p>They came out of the darkness of
Transpace that evening and the stars
returned in the glory of a million
closely gathered suns. The Markovian
Nucleus lay in a galaxy of tightly
packed stars that made bright the
nights of all their planets. It was a
spectacle for Cameron, who had traveled
but little away from the Solar
System, and for Joyce who had never
traveled at all.</p>

<p>Marthasa and Sal Karone were
with them in the lounge watching
the screens as the ship changed
drives. The Markovian squinted a
moment and pointed to a minor dot
near the corner of the view. "That's
our destination. Another six hours
and you can set foot on the best
planet in the whole Universe!"</p>

<p>If it had been mere enthusiasm,
Cameron could have taken it with
tolerant understanding. But Marthasa's
smugness and arrogance had not
deserted him once since the beginning
of this leg of the trip. Objectively,
as a cultural facet to be examined,
it was interesting, but Cameron
agreed with Joyce that it was
going to be difficult to live with.</p>

<p>The unsolved puzzle, however,
was Sal Karone. It was obvious that
the Id was sensitive to the gauche
ways of the Master, yet his equally
obvious devotion was unwavering.</p>

<p>Marthasa had sent word ahead to
the government that he desired the
Terrans to be his guests. Evidently
he was a person of influence for
assent was returned immediately.</p>

<p>His planet was a colorful world,
banded by huge, golden deserts and
pinkish seas. The dense vegetation of
the habitable areas was blue with
only a scattered touch of green. Cameron
wondered about the chemistry
involved.</p>

<p>The landing was made at a port
that bordered a sea. The four of them
were the only ones disembarking,
and before the car that met them had
reached the edge of the city the ship
was gone again.</p>

<p>A pirates' lair, Cameron thought,
without the slightest touch of amusement.
The field looked very old, and
from it he could imagine raiders had
once taken off to harass distant shipping
and do wanton destruction of
cities and peoples on innocent worlds.</p>

<p>He watched the face of Marthasa
as they rode through the city. There
was a kind of Roman splendor in
what they saw, and there was a crude
Roman pride in the Markovian who
was their host. The arrogance, that
was not far from cruelty, could take
such pride in the sweep of spaceships
embarking on missions of murder
and plunder.</p>

<p>And yet all this barbarism had
been put aside. Only the arrogance
remained, expressed in Marthasa's
tone as he called their attention to
the features of the city and landscape
through which they passed. It wasn't
pleasing particularly to Terran tastes,
but Cameron guessed that it represented
a considerable accomplishment
to the Markovians. Stone appeared
to be the chief building material,
and, while the craftsmanship was
exact, the lines of the structures
lacked the grace of the Greek and
Roman monuments of which Cameron
was reminded.</p>

<p>They came at last to the house of
Marthasa. There was no doubt now
that he was a man of wealth or
importance&mdash;probably both. He occupied
a vast, villa-like structure set
on a low hill overlooking the city.
It was a place of obvious luxury in
the economic scale of the Markovians.</p>

<p>They were assigned spacious quarters
overlooking a garden of incredible
colors beyond the transparent
wall facing it. Sal Karone was also
assigned duties as their personal attendant,
which Cameron grasped intuitively
was a gesture of supreme
honor among the Markovians. He
thanked Marthasa profusely for this
courtesy.</p>

<p>After getting unpacked they were
shown through the house and
grounds and met Marthasa's family.
His wife was a woman of considerable
beauty even by Terran standards,
but there was a sharpness in her manner
and a sense of coldness in the
small black eyes that repelled Cameron
and Joyce even as the thoughtless
actions of Marthasa had done.</p>

<p>Cameron looked carefully for the
same qualities in the three smaller
children who were at home, and
found them easily. In none of them
was there the aura of serenity possessed
by the Id servants.</p>

<p>When they were finally alone that
night Cameron sat down to make
some notes on their observations up
to date. "The fault line I mentioned
is so obvious you can't miss it," he
said to Joyce. "It's as if they're living
one kind of life because they
think it's the thing to do, but all
their thoughts and feelings are being
drawn invisibly in another direction&mdash;and
they're half ashamed of it."</p>

<p>"Maybe the Ids have something
to do with it. Remember Marthasa's
statement that the relationship of the
<i>sarghs</i> does something to the Markovians?
If we found out exactly what
that something is, we might have
the answer."</p>

<p>Cameron shook his head. "I've
tried to fit it together that way, too,
but it just doesn't add up. The basic
premise of the Ids is asceticism and
there never was any strength in that
idea. Marthasa is probably right in
his estimate of the Ids. They have
achieved an internal serenity but only
through compensating their basic
weakness with the crude strength of
the Markovians and other races to
which they cling. They haven't the
strength to build a civilization of
their own. Certainly they haven't got
the power to influence the whole
Nucleus. No&mdash;we'll have to look a
good deal farther than the Ids before
we find the answer. I'm convinced
of that, even though I'd like to find
out exactly what makes <i>them</i> tick.
Maybe next trip&mdash;"</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>The following days were spent in
almost profitless activity as far as
their basic purpose in being in the
Nucleus was concerned. Marthasa and
his wife took them on long tours
through the city and into the scenic
areas of the continent. They promised
trips over the whole planet and to
other worlds of the Nucleus. There
seemed no end to the sight-seeing
that was proposed for them to do.</p>

<p>Cameron improved his facility with
the language, and Joyce was beginning
to get along without the translator.
They were introduced to a
considerable number of other Markovians,
including the official representative
of Premier Jargla. This gave
them added contact with the Markovian
character, but Marthasa and his
family seemed so typical of the race
that scarcely anything new was learned
from the others.</p>

<p>At no time was anything hinted in
reference to the original reluctance
to have the Terrans visit the Nucleus.
All possible courtesy was shown
them now, and Cameron dared not
mention the invitations to stay home.
He felt the situation was as penetrable
as a thick wall of sponge rubber
backed by a ten-foot foundation of
steel.</p>

<p>After three weeks of this, however,
he cautiously broached the subject of
meeting the son and daughter of
Marthasa in regard to visiting the
library and museum. He had met
each of them just once and found
them rather cool to his presence. He
had not dared express his interest in
their specialties at that time.</p>

<p>Marthasa was favorable and apologetic,
however. "I have intended to
arrange it," he said. "There have
been so many other things to do
that I have neglected your interest in
these things. We won't neglect it
any longer. Suppose we make an appointment
for this afternoon? Zlenon
will be able to give you his personal
attention."</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 168px;">
<img src="images/003.png" width="168" height="500" alt="JOYCE" title="" />
</div>

<p>Zlenon was Marthasa's son, who
held the position of Chief Historian
at the research library. He was more
slender and darker than his father,
and lacking in his volubility and
glad-handedness.</p>

<p>He greeted Cameron's request with
a tolerant smile. "You have to be
quite specific, Mr. Wilder, when you
say you would like to know about
the history of the Markovian Nucleus.
You understand the Nucleus
consists of over a hundred worlds
and has a composite history extending
back more than thirty thousand
of your years in very minute detail."</p>

<p>Cameron countered with a helpless
shrug and smile. "I'm afraid I'll
have to depend on your good nature
to guide me through such a mass.
I don't intend to become a student
of Markovian history, of course, but
perhaps you have adequate summaries
with which a stranger could start.
Going backward, let us say, for perhaps
two or three hundred Terran
years?"</p>

<p>"Of course&mdash;some very excellent
ones are available&mdash;" He moved
toward the reading table nearby and
began punching a selection of buttons.</p>

<p>As Cameron and Joyce moved to
follow, Marthasa waved a hand expansively
and started out the other
way. "I can see you're going to be
set for a while. I'll just leave you
here, and send the car back after I
reach the house. Don't be late for
dinner."</p>

<p>They nodded and smiled and turned
to Zlenon. The Markovian was
watching them with pin-point eyes.
"I wondered if there was any <i>particular</i>
problem in which you might be
interested," he said calmly. "If there
is&mdash;?"</p>

<p>Cameron shook his head hastily.
"No&mdash;certainly not. Just general information&mdash;"</p>

<p>The Historian turned his attention
to the table and began explaining its
use to the Terrans, showing how they
could obtain recording of any specific
material they wished to choose. It
would appear in either printed or
pictorial form or could be had on
audio if they wanted it. Once he was
certain they could make their own
selections he left them to their study.</p>

<p>"This is the best break we could
possibly have hoped for," Joyce
whispered as Zlenon disappeared
from their sight. "We can get anything
we want in the whole library
if I understand the operation of this
gadget the way I think I do."</p>

<p>"That's the way it looks to me,"
Cameron answered. "But don't get
your hopes too high. There must be
a catch in it somewhere, the way
they were trying to shoo us away
from coming here."</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>They punched the buttons for the
history of the planet they were on,
scanning slowly from the present to
earlier years. There were endless accountings
of trading and commercial
treaties between members of the Nucleus
as shifts of economic balance
occurred. There were stories of explorations
and benevolent contacts
with races on the outer worlds. Details
of their most outstanding scientific
discoveries, which seemed to
come with profligate rapidity&mdash;</p>

<p>Cameron whipped back through
the pages of the histories, searching
only for a single item, one clue to
the swift evolution from barbarism
to peaceful co-operation. After an
hour he was in the middle of that
critical period when the Council despaired
of its inability to cope with
the Markovian menace.</p>

<p>But the stories of commerce and
invention and far-flung exchange
with other peoples continued. Nowhere
was there any reference to the
violence of the period. They went
back two hundred&mdash;five hundred
years&mdash;beyond the time when Council
members first made contact with
the Nucleus.</p>

<p>There was nothing.</p>

<p>Cameron sat back in complete puzzlement
as it became apparent that
it was useless to go back further.
"The normal thing would be for
them to brag all over the place about
their great conquests. Even races who
become comparatively civilized citizens
ordinarily let themselves go
when it comes to history. If they've
had a long record of conquest and
bloodshed, they say so with plenty
of chest pounding. Of course, it's
padded out to reflect their righteous
conquest over tyranny, but it's always
there in <i>some</i> form.</p>

<p>"But nothing up to now has been
normal about the development of
the Markovian problem and this really
tops it off&mdash;the complete omission
of any reference to their armed conquests."</p>

<p>"Maybe this planet didn't participate
very much. Perhaps only a small
number of the Nucleus worlds were
responsible for it," said Joyce.</p>

<p>Cameron shook his head. "No.
The Council records show that the
Nucleus as a unit was responsible,
and that virtually all the worlds are
specifically mentioned. And even if
this one had been out of it completely
you could still expect references
to it because there was constant
interchange with most of the
other planets. We can try another
one, though&mdash;"</p>

<p>They tried one more, then a half
dozen in quick scanning. They swept
through a summarization of the Nucleus
as a whole during that critical
period.</p>

<p>There was nothing to show that
the Markovians had ever been anything
but peace-loving citizens intent
on pursuit of science, commerce, and
the arts.</p>

<p>"This could have been rigged for
our special benefit," said Joyce
thoughtfully as they ended the day's
futile search. "They didn't want to
apply enough pressure to keep us
from coming, but they did want to
make sure we wouldn't find out anything
about their past."</p>

<p>Cameron shook his head slowly.
"It couldn't have been done in the
time they've had. Simply cutting out
what they didn't want to show us
wouldn't have done it. There's too
much cross reference to all periods
involved. It's a complete phony, but
it's not something done on the spur
of the moment just for our benefit.
It's too good for that."</p>

<p>"Maybe they've had it for a <i>long</i>
time&mdash;just in case somebody like us
should come along."</p>

<p>"It's possible, but I don't think
that's right either," said Cameron.
"I can't give you any reason for
thinking so&mdash;except the phoniness
goes deeper than merely deceiving an
investigator. Somehow I have the
feeling that the Markovians are even
deceiving themselves!"</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>They left the building and took
the car back to the house of Marthasa
without seeing Zlenon again.
Their Markovian host was waiting.
Cameron thought he sensed a trace
of tension in Marthasa that wasn't
there before as he led them to seats
in the garden.</p>

<p>"We don't like to boast about the
Nucleus," he said with his customary
volubility, "but we have to admit
we are proud of our science and
technology. Few civilizations in the
Universe can match it. That's not to
disparage the fine accomplishments
of the Terrans, you understand, but
it's only <i>natural</i> that out here on
these older worlds&mdash;"</p>

<p>They listened half attentively, trying
in their imaginations to pierce
the armor he used to defend so frantically
the thing the Markovians did
not want the outer worlds to know
anything about.</p>

<p>The talk went on during mealtime.
Marthasa's wife caught the spirit of
it and they both regaled the Terrans
with accounts of the grandeur of
Markovian exploits. Cameron grew
more and more depressed by it, and
as they retired to their rooms early
he began to realize how absolutely
complete was the impasse into which
they had been driven.</p>

<p>"They've let us in," he said to
Joyce. "They've shown us the history
they've written of themselves. There's
no way in the Universe we can stand
up and boldly challenge that history
and call them the liars we know they
are."</p>

<p>"But they must know of the histories
written on other Council worlds
about their doings," said Joyce.
"Maybe we could reach a point where
we could at least ask about them.
Ask how it is that other histories
show that a hundred and twenty
years ago a fleet of Markovian ships
swept unexpectedly out of space and
looted and decimated the planet Lakcaine
VI. Ask why the Markovian
history says only that the Nucleus
concluded six new commercial treaties
to the benefit of all worlds concerned
in that period, without any
mention of Lakcaine VI."</p>

<p>"When you start asking questions
like that you've got to be ready to
run. And if it fizzles out you've lost
all chance of coming back for a second
try. That could fizzle out because
they simply deny the validity of all
history outside their own."</p>

<p>"Then we might as well pack and
go home if you're not going to challenge
any of this stuff they hand out.
We won't find the answer by standing
around and taking <i>their</i> word on
everything."</p>

<p>"I forgot to tell you one thing,"
Cameron said slowly. "We may not
have to take their word for it. Someone
else here knows the truth of the
situation, also."</p>

<p>"Who?"</p>

<p>"The Ids." He told her then of
the warning Sal Karone had given
him aboard the ship on the way to
the Nucleus, the statement that "My
Masters are a people who cannot yet
be understood by the men of other
worlds."</p>

<p>"The Ids know what the Markovians
are and what they are trying to
hide. I had almost overlooked that
simple fact."</p>

<p>"But you can't go out and challenge
them to tell the truth any more
than you can the Markovians!" Joyce
protested. "Because Sal Karone went
out of his way to warn you doesn't
mean he's going to get real buddy-buddy
and tell you everything you
want to know."</p>

<p>"No, of course not. But there's
one little difference between him and
the Markovians. He has admitted
openly that he knows why we're
here. None of the Markovians have
done that yet. We don't have to challenge
him because there already exists
the tacit understanding that something
is decidedly phony.</p>

<p>"And besides, he invited us to
come and visit the Id communities
outside the city. I think that's an
invitation we should accept just as
soon as possible."</p>


<p class="theend">IV</p>

<p>Sal Karone had not repeated his
invitation that the Terrans visit the
Id communities, but he showed no
adverse reaction when Cameron said
they would like to take him up on
his previous offer.</p>

<p>"You will be very welcome," he
said. A soft smile lightened his features.
"I will notify my leaders you
will come."</p>

<p>With a start, Cameron realized
that the existence of any kind of
community probably implied leaders,
but he had ignored this in view of
Marthasa's insistence that the Ids had
no culture of their own. He wondered
just how untrue that assertion
might be.</p>

<p>For the first time, he sensed genuine
disapproval in the attitude of
Marthasa when he mentioned plans
to go with Sal Karone to the Id
centers. "There's nothing out there
you'd want to see," the Markovian
said. "Their village is only a group
of crude huts in the forest. It'll be a
waste of your time to go out there
when there's so much else we could
show you."</p>

<p>"Sal Karone suggested the visit
before we arrived," said Cameron.
"He'd be hurt if we turned him
down. Perhaps just to satisfy him&mdash;"</p>

<p>Angry indecision hid behind Marthasa's
eyes. "Well&mdash;maybe that
makes it different," he said finally.
"We try to do everything possible
to make the Ids happy. It's up to
you if you want to waste your time
on the visit."</p>

<p>"I think I do. Sal Karone has been
very attentive and pleasant to us.
It's a small favor in return."</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>Early in the morning, two days
later, they left with Sal Karone directing
them to the Idealist center.
They discovered that the term, at the
edge of the city, was a mere euphemism.
It was a long two-hour trip at
the high speed of which the Markovian
cars were capable.</p>

<p>The city itself vanished, and a
thickly wooded area took its place
during the last half of the journey,
reminding them of the few remote,
peaceful forests of Earth. Then, as
the car slowed, they left the highway
for a rough trail that led for a number
of miles back into the forest.
They came at last into a clearing circled
by rough wooden dwellings possessing
all the appearance of crude,
primitive existence on little more than
a subsistence level.</p>

<p>"This is the village of our Chief,"
said Sal Karone. "He will be pleased
to explain all you may wish to know
about the Idealist Way."</p>

<p>Cameron was shocked almost beyond
speech by his first sight of the
clearing. He had tried to prepare for
the worst, but he had told himself
that the Markovian's estimate of the
Ids could not be true. Now he was
forced to admit that it was. In contact
with all the skills of their Masters,
which they would certainly be
permitted to learn if they wanted to,
the Ids chose primitive squalor when
they were on their own.</p>

<p>Their serenity could be little more
than the serenity of the savage who
has no wants or goals and is content
to merely serve those whose ambitions
are greater. It was the serenity
and peacefulness of death. The Ids
had died&mdash;as a race&mdash;long ago. The
Markovians were loud, boastful, and
obnoxious, but that could be discounted
as the awkwardness of youth
in a race that would perhaps be very
great in the Universe at a time when
the Ids were wholly forgotten.</p>

<p>Cameron felt depressed by the
sight. He began to doubt the wisdom
of his coming here in hope of finding
an answer to the Markovian deception.
The warning of Sal Karone on
shipboard seemed now like nothing
more than a half ignorant demonstration
of loyalty toward the Markovian
Masters. Possibly there had been
some talk which the Id had overheard
and he had taken it upon himself
to warn the Terrans&mdash;knowing perhaps
nothing of the matter which the
Markovians were reluctant to expose.</p>

<p>If he could have done so gracefully,
Cameron felt he would have
turned and gone back without bothering
with the interview. His curiosity
about the Ids themselves had all but
vanished. The answer to their situation
was obvious. And he had maintained
such high hope that somehow
his expectation in them would be
fulfilled during this visit.</p>

<p>There was a satisfying cleanliness
apparent in everything as Sal Karone
led them to the largest of the buildings.
Joyce seemed to be enjoying
herself as she surveyed the surroundings
with an interest Cameron had
lost.</p>

<p>As they entered the doorway a
thin, straight old man with a white
beard arose from a chair and approached
them in greeting. The ancient,
conventional, patriarchal order,
Cameron thought. He could see the
whole setup in a nutshell right now.
Squalid communities like this where
the too-old and the too-young were
nurtured on the calcified traditions
to which nothing was ever added.
The able serving in the homes of
the Markovians, providing sustenance
for themselves and those who
depended on them. The Markovians
were generous indeed in not referring
to the Ids as slaves. There was little
else they could ever be called.</p>

<p>The Chief was addressed as Venor
by Sal Karone, who introduced them.
"It is kind of you to include our
village in your visit to the Nucleus,"
said Venor. "There are many more
spectacular things to see."</p>

<p>"There is often greatest wisdom
in the least spectacular," said Cameron,
trying to sound like a sage.
"Sal Karone was kind enough to
invite us to your center and said there
was much you could show us."</p>

<p>"The things of the soul are not
possible to <i>show</i>," said Venor gently.
"We wish there were time that we
might teach you some of the great
things our people have learned in
their long wanderings. I am told
that your profession and your purpose
in being here is the study of
races and their actions and the things
they have learned."</p>

<p>With a start, Cameron came to
greater attention. He was certain he
had never given any such information
in the presence of Sal Karone or
Marthasa. Yet even Venor knew he
was a sociologist! Here was the first
knowledge that must lie behind the
evidence of the undercurrent of
objections of the Markovian representative
in the Council and Premier
Jargla.</p>

<p>And this primitive patriarch was in
possession of it.</p>

<p>Relations between the individuals
of this planet were something far
more complex than Cameron had
assumed. He hesitated a moment before
speaking. Just why had this bait
been so innocently thrown to him?
Marthasa had never mentioned it.
Yet had the Markovians asked for
an attempt to get an admission from
him for their own purposes? And
what purposes&mdash;?</p>

<p>He abandoned caution, and nodded.
"Yes, that is the thing I am
interested in. I had hoped to study
the history and ways of the Markovians.
As Sal Karone has told me,
they don't want strangers to make
such a study. You are perhaps not
so unwilling to be known&mdash;?"</p>

<p>"We wish the entire Universe
might know of us and be as we are."</p>

<p>"You hardly make that possible,
subjugating your identity so completely
to that of another race. The
worlds will never know of you unless
you become strong and unified as a
people and obtain a name of your
own."</p>

<p>"Our name is known," said Venor.
"We are the Idealists. You will not
find many worlds on which we are
unknown, and they call us the ones
who serve. Even on your world you
have the saying of a philosopher who
taught that any who would be master
should become the servant of all.
Your people once understood it."</p>

<p>"Not as a literal undertaking,"
said Cameron. "You can't submerge
your entire racial identity as you have
done. That is not what the saying
meant."</p>

<p>"To us it does," said Venor solemnly.
"We would master the Universe&mdash;and
therefore we must serve
it. That is the core of the law of the
Idealists."</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>Cameron let his gaze scan through
the window to the small clearing
in the thick forest, to the circle of
wooden houses. <i>We would master the
Universe</i>&mdash;he restrained a smile.</p>

<p>"You cannot believe this," said
Venor, "because you have never understood
the mark of the servant or
the mark of the master. How often
is there difficulty in distinguishing
one from the other!"</p>

<p>And how often do the illusions of
the mind ease the privations of the
body, Cameron thought. So that was
the source of the Idealist serenity.
Wherever they went they considered
themselves the masters through service&mdash;and
conversely, those they
served became the slaves, he supposed.
It was a pleasant, easy philosophy
that hurt no one. Except the
ones who believed it. They died the
moment they accepted it, for all initiative
and desire were gone.</p>

<p>"The master is he who guides the
destiny of a man or a race," said
Venor almost in meditation. "He is
not the man who gathers or disperses
the wealth, or who builds the cities
and the ships to the stars. The master
is he who teaches what must be done
with these things and how a people
shall expend their lives."</p>

<p>"And the Markovians do this, in
obedience to you?" said Cameron
whimsically.</p>

<p>"Wherever my people are," answered
Venor, "strife ceases and
peace comes. Who can do this is
master of worlds."</p>

<p>There was a strange solemnity
about the voice and figure of the old
Idealist that checked the sense of
ridiculousness in Cameron. It seemed
somehow strangely moving.</p>

<p>"You believe the worlds are better,"
he asked gently, "just because
you are there?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said Venor, "because we
are there."</p>

<p>There was a pathos about it that
fired Cameron's anger. On scores of
worlds there were primitive groups
like this one, blinding themselves
with a glory that didn't exist, in the
grip of ancient, meaningless traditions.
The younger ones&mdash;like Sal
Karone&mdash;were intelligent, worth salvaging,
but they could never be lifted
out of this mire of false belief
unless they could be shown how
empty it was.</p>

<p>"Nothing you have said explains
the mystery of how this great thing
is accomplished," said Cameron almost
angrily. "Even if we wanted to
believe it were true, it is still as
utterly incomprehensible as before we
came."</p>

<p>"There is a saying among us," said
Venor kindly. "Translated into your
tongue it would be: How was the
wild dog tamed, and a saddle put
upon the fierce stallion?"</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>Stubbornly, then, Venor would say
no more about the philosophy of the
Idealists. He spoke freely of the
many other worlds upon which the
Idealists lived and served, and he
affirmed the tradition that they did
not even know the place of their
origin, the planet that might have
been their home world.</p>

<p>He was evasive, however, when
Cameron asked when the first contact
was made between his people
and the Markovians. There was
something that the Ids, too, were
holding back, the sociologist thought,
and there was no apparent reason for
it.</p>

<p>Recklessly, he decided nothing
could be lost by attempting to blast
for it. "Why have the Markovians
consistently lied to us?" he said.
"They've given us their history&mdash;and
if your people know the feelings of
other worlds they know this history
is a lie. Only a few generations ago
the Markovians pirated and plundered
these worlds, and now they pose
as little tin gods with a silver halo.
Why?"</p>

<p>Sal Karone stood by with a look
of horror on his face, but Venor
made no sign of alarm at this forbidden
question. He merely inclined
his held slowly and repeated, "How
was the wild dog tamed, and a saddle
put upon the fierce stallion?"</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>That was the end of the interview.
The Ids insisted, however, that he
inspect the rest of the village and
they personally guided the Terrans
on the tour. Cameron's trained eye
took in at a glance, however, the
evidence supporting his previous conclusion.
The artifacts and buildings
demonstrated a primitive forest culture.
The other individuals he saw
were almost entirely the old and very
young&mdash;the ones unsuitable as servants
to the Markovians. Venor explained
that family life among them
paralleled in general that of the Masters.
Whole Idealist families lived
and served as units in the Markovian
household. Exceptions existed
in the case of Sal Karone and
others of his age who were separated
from their families and had not yet
begun their own.</p>

<p>As they returned to the car Venor
took their hands. He pressed Cameron's
warmly and looked into his eyes
with deep sincerity. "You have made
us glad by your presence," he said.
"And when the time comes for you
to return, we shall repay all the
pleasure you have given us."</p>

<p>"I'm afraid we won't be able to
do that," said Cameron. "We appreciate
your hospitality, but I'm
sure time will not permit us to visit
you again, as much as we'd like to."
In the past few minutes he had
reached the conclusion that further
research on this whole planet was
futile. The best thing they could do
was go somewhere else in the Nucleus
and make a fresh start.</p>

<p>Venor shook his head, smiling.
"We will see each other again, Joyce
and Cameron. I feel that the day
will be very soon."</p>

<p>It was senseless to let himself be
irritated by the senile patriarch who
spoke out of a world of illusion but
Cameron could not help feeling nettled
as he started back to the city.
Somehow it seemed impossible to
regard Venor as merely a specimen
for sociological research. The Chief
of the Idealists reached out of his
unreal world and made his contact
with the Terrans a personal thing&mdash;almost
as if he had spent all his life
waiting for their coming. There was
a sense of intimacy against which
Cameron rebelled, and yet it was not
an unpleasant thing.</p>

<p>Cameron's mind oscillated between
the annoyance of Venor's calm assertion
that they would be back
shortly, and the nonsense of the Id
belief that they controlled the civilizations
in which they were servants.
How was the wild dog tamed, and
a saddle put upon the fierce stallion?</p>

<p>He smiled faintly to himself, wondering
if the Markovians were fully
aware that the Ids regarded them as
tamed dogs and saddled stallions.
They couldn't help knowing, of
course, but it was hard to imagine
Marthasa and his wife being very
much amused by such an estimate.
The situation would be intolerable,
however, if it were met by anything
except amusement. It might be a
mildly explosive subject, but he was
going to find out about that one
small item before moving on, anyway,
Cameron decided.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>Sal Karone was strangely silent
during the whole of the return trip.
He offered no comments and made
only brief, noncommittal replies to
questions about the country through
which they passed. He seemed depressed
by the results of their visit.
Probably because the violation of his
warning to not question the lives of
the Markovians. It was a curious
evidence of their completely unreal,
proprietary attitude in respect to their
Masters. They'd have to investigate
Marthasa's response as thoroughly as
possible. There seemed to be no
taboo on discussion of the Ids with
him.</p>

<p>His annoyance at their acceptance
of the invitation to the Id village
appeared to have vanished as he
greeted them upon their return. "We
delayed eating, thinking you'd be
back in time. If you'll join us in
the dining room as soon as you're
ready&mdash;?"</p>

<p>The villa of Marthasa seemed different
after the day's experience with
the Ids, although Cameron was certain
nothing had changed either in
a physical way or in their relations
with the Markovians. It was as if his
senses had been somehow sharpened
to detect an undercurrent of feeling
of which he had previously been unaware.
Glancing at Joyce, he sensed
she felt the same.</p>

<p>"I have the feeling that we missed
something," she said, as they changed
clothes to join Marthasa and his wife.
"There was something Venor wanted
us to know and wouldn't say. I
would almost like to go back there
again before we go away."</p>

<p>Cameron was surprised at his own
annoyance with Joyce's statement. It
reflected the impressions in his own
mind which he was trying to ignore.
"Nonsense," he said. "There's no use
trying to read great profundity in the
words of an old patriarch of the
woods. He's nothing except what he
appears to be."</p>

<p>The Markovians talked easily of
Venor and the rest of the Ids. "We
have tried to get him to join us in
the city," said Marthasa as the meal
began, "but he won't hear of it. It
seems to give him a sense of importance
to live out there alone with his
retinue and have the other Ids come
to him with their problems. He's a
kind of arbiter and patriarch to all
of them for many miles around."</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 599px;">
<img src="images/004.png" width="599" height="265" alt="" title="" />
</div>

<p>While Marthasa talked Cameron
tried to bring his awareness of all
the varied facets of the problem together
and see it whole, as he now
understood it. The Markovians, a
vast pirate community, had voluntarily
abandoned freebooting for reasons
yet to be discovered. They had
turned their backs upon it so forcibly
that they hid even the history of their
depredations. And one of their last
acts must have been the capture of
a large colony of Idealists who were
forced into servitude. Now the Ids
compensated their enslavement by
the religious belief that service made
them masters over the ex-pirates, convincing
themselves that <i>they</i> had
changed the Markovians, taming
them like wild dogs, saddling them
as fierce stallions&mdash;</p>

<p>Cameron wondered if he dared,
and then dismissed the thought that
there could be any risk. It was too
ridiculous!</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>There was even a half-malicious
smile on his lips as he broke into
Marthasa's conversation. "One of the
things that made me very curious
today," he said, "was the general reaction
of your people to the Idealist
illusion that they have <i>tamed</i> you&mdash;as
expressed in their aphorism about
how was the wild dog&mdash;?"</p>

<p>He never finished. Across the table
the faces of the Markovians had
frozen in sudden bitterness. The
shield of friendliness vanished under
the cold glare from their eyes.</p>

<p>Marthasa's lips seemed to curl as
he whispered, "So you came like all
the rest! And we wanted so much to
believe you were honest. A study! A
chance to find material for lies about
the Nucleus to spread among all the
Council worlds."</p>

<p>He continued almost sadly, "You
will be confined to your quarters
until transfer authorities can arrange
for your return to Earth. And you
may be sure that never again will
such a scheme get one of your kind
into the Nucleus again."</p>

<p>But there was no hint of sadness
in his wife's face. She glared coldly.
"I said they should never had been
permitted to come!"</p>

<p>Cameron rose in sudden bewildered
protest. "I assure you we have no
intention&mdash;" he began.</p>

<p>And then he stopped. In one moment
of incredible clarity while they
stood there, eyes locked in bitter
stares, he understood. He knew the
myth was not a myth. It was cold,
unbelievable reality. The Ids <i>had</i>
tamed the Markovians.</p>

<p>In a moment of fear he wondered
if it were anything more than a thin
shell that could be shattered by a
whisper from a stupid dabbler in
cultures, who really knew nothing
at all about the profession to which
he pretended.</p>


<p class="theend">V</p>

<p>As if upon some secret signal Sal
Karone appeared from the serving
room at their left.</p>

<p>"Our visitors are no longer our
guests," Marthasa said sharply with
accusing eyes still upon Cameron.
"They will remain in their rooms
until time for deportation.</p>

<p>"I trust it will not be necessary to
use force," he said directly to Cameron.</p>

<p>"Of course not. But won't you let
me explain&mdash;won't you even allow
an apology for breaking a taboo we
did not understand?"</p>

<p>"Is it not taboo among all civilized
peoples, including your own, to invent
and spread lies about those who
wish you only well?"</p>

<p>It was useless to argue, Cameron
saw. He turned, taking Joyce's arm,
and allowed Sal Karone to lead them
back to their rooms. As they paused
at the doorway the Id spoke without
expression on his dark face. "This
is not a good thing, Cameron Wilder.
It would have been best for you to
have considered my warning."</p>

<p>He turned and stepped away, locking
the door behind him.</p>

<p>Joyce slumped on the bed in dejection.
"This is a fine fix we've got
ourselves into, being declared <i>persona
non grata</i> before we even get a good
start! They'll remember <i>that</i> back
home when A Study of the Metamorphosis
of the Markovian Nucleus
is mentioned in professional circles!"</p>

<p>"Don't rub it in," Cameron said,
half angrily. "How was I to know
that was such a vicious taboo? It can't
be any secret to the Markovians that
the Ids look upon them as tamed.
Why should they get their hackles
up because <i>I</i> mentioned it?"</p>

<p>"All I know is we're washed up
as of now. What do we do when we
get back home?"</p>

<p>Cameron stood with his back to
her, looking through the windows to
the garden beyond. "I'm not thinking
of that," he said. "Can't you see
we haven't failed? We've almost got
it&mdash;the thing we came to find. We
<i>knew</i> why the Markovians suddenly
became good Indians. The Ids actually
did tame them. We've got to
find out how such an apparently impossible
thing could be done."</p>

<p>"Do you really believe that's what
happened?" asked Joyce.</p>

<p>Cameron nodded. "It's the only
thing there is to believe. If it weren't
true, Marthasa and his wife would
have laughed it off as nonsense. Getting
all huffy and talking about deportation
for cooking up lies is the
best proof you could ask for that we
hit pay dirt. Don't ask me how I
think the Ids could do it. <i>That's</i> what
I'm going to find out."</p>

<p>"How?"</p>

<p>"I don't know."</p>

<p>But he did have an idea that if he
could somehow get word to the old
Id chieftain help could be had. He
knew he was straining to believe
things he wanted to believe, yet it
seemed as if this were almost the
very thing Venor had tried to convey
the day before but had left unspoken.</p>

<p>There was only one possibility of
establishing contact, however, and
that was through Sal Karone. A
remote chance indeed, Cameron
thought, in view of the relationship
between the Markovian and his
<i>sargh</i>. As a last resort it was worth
trying, however.</p>

<p>It looked as if they would not
have even this chance as the evening
grew darker. Cameron kept watch
through the windows in the hope of
signaling Sal Karone in case he
should appear. They hoped he might
come to the room for a final check of
their needs for the night as he usually
did.</p>

<p>But he did not appear.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>Cameron finally went to bed after
Joyce was long asleep. He turned
restlessly, beating his mind with increasing
wonder as to how it could
be so incredibly true that the Idealists
were the actual masters of the Nucleus.
That they had somehow tamed
the murderous, piratical Markovians.
He couldn't have known this was it!</p>

<p>One thing he could understood,
however, was the Markovians reluctance
to have visitors&mdash;and their careful
watch over them. Marthasa had
been more than a host, he thought.
He was a guard as well, trying to
keep the Terrans from discovering
the unpleasant reality concerning the
influence of the Ids. He had slipped
in allowing the visit to Venor.</p>

<p>At dawn there was the sound of
their door opening and Cameron
whirled from his dressing, hopeful
it might be Sal Karone. It was Marthasa,
however, grim and distant. "I
have obtained word that your deportation
can be accomplished today.
Premier Jargla has been informed
and concurs. The Council has been
notified and offers no protestations.
You will ready yourselves before the
evening hour."</p>

<p>He slammed the door behind him.
Joyce turned down the covers in the
other room and sat up. "I wonder if
he isn't even going to feed us
today?"</p>

<p>Cameron made no answer. He
finished dressing hurriedly and kept
a frantic watch for any sign of Sal
Karone.</p>

<p>At last there was a knock on the
door and the Id appeared with breakfast
on a cart. Cameron exhaled with
relief that it was not one of the other
<i>sarghs</i> in the household.</p>

<p>Sal Karone eyed them impassively
as he wheeled in and arranged the
food on the table by a window.
Cameron watched, estimating his
chances.</p>

<p>"Your Chief, Venor, was very
kind to us yesterday," he said quietly.
"Our biggest regret in leaving is that
our conversation with him must go
unfinished."</p>

<p>Sal Karone paused. "Were there
things you had yet to say to him?"
he asked.</p>

<p>"No&mdash;there were things Venor
wanted to tell us. You heard him.
He wanted us to come back. It is
completely impossible for us to see
him again before we go?"</p>

<p>Sal Karone straightened and set
the utensils on the table. "No, it is
not impossible. I have been instructed
to bring you back to the village
if it should be your request."</p>

<p>Cameron felt a surge of eager
excitement within him. "When? Our
deportation is scheduled for today.
How can we get there? How can
we avoid Marthasa and the Markovians?"</p>

<p>"Stand very quietly," said Sal
Karone, that sense of power and
command in his voice and bearing
as Cameron had seen it once before
aboard the spaceship. "Now," he
said. "Close your eyes."</p>

<p>There was a sudden wrenching
twist as if two solid surfaces had
slammed them from front and back,
and a third force had thrust them
sideways.</p>

<p>They opened their eyes in the
wooden house of Venor, in the village
of the Idealists.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>"We owe you apologies," said
Venor. "We hope you are not harmed
in any way."</p>

<p>Cameron stared around uncertainly.
Joyce clutched his hand. "How
did we&mdash;?" Cameron stammered.</p>

<p>"Teleportation is the descriptive
term in your language, I believe,"
said Venor. "It was rather urgent
that you come without further delay
so we resorted to it. Nothing else
would do in the face of Marthasa's
action. Sit down if you will, please.
If you wish to rest or eat, your quarters
are ready."</p>

<p>"Our quarters&mdash;! Then you <i>did</i>
expect us back. You knew this was
going to happen exactly as it has!"</p>

<p>"Yes, I knew," said Venor quietly.
"I planned it this way when word
first came to us of your visit."</p>

<p>"I think we are entitled to explanations,"
Cameron said at last. "We
seem to have been pieces in a game
we knew nothing about."</p>

<p>And it had taken this long for the
full impact of Venor's admission of
teleportation to hit him. He closed
his eyes in a moment's reaction of
fright. He didn't want to believe it&mdash;and
knew he must. These Idealists&mdash;who
could master galaxies and
tame the wild Markovians&mdash;was
there anything they could not do?</p>

<p>"Not a game," Venor protested.
"We planned this because we wanted
you to see what you have seen. We
wanted a man of Earth to know
what we have done."</p>

<p>"But don't the Markovians realize
the foolishness of deporting us because
we stumbled onto the relationship
between you and them? And if
you are in control how can they issue
such an order&mdash;unless you want it?"</p>

<p>"Our relationship is more complex
than that. There are different levels
of control. We operate the one that
brought you here&mdash;" He let Cameron
consider the implication of the unfinished
statement.</p>

<p>Then he continued, "To understand
the Markovians' reason for
deporting you, consider that on Earth
men have tamed wolves and made
faithful, loyal dogs who can be
trusted. Dogs who have forever lost
the knowledge their ancestors were
fierce marauders ready to rip and tear
the flesh of any man or beast that
came their way.</p>

<p>"Consider the dogs only a generation
or two from the vicious wolves
who were their forebears. The old
urges have not entirely died, yet they
want to know man's affection and
trust. Could you remind them of
what their kind once was without
stirring up torment within them?</p>

<p>"So it is with the Markovians.
They are peaceful and creative, but
only a few generations behind them
are pirates who were not fit to sit
in the Councils of civilized beings.
They have no tradition of culture to
support them. It knocks the props
out from under them, so to speak,
to have it known what lies behind
them. They cannot be friends with
such a man. They cannot even endure
the knowledge among themselves."</p>

<p>"Then I was right!" Cameron exclaimed.
"Their phony history <i>was</i>
set up to deceive their own people
as well as others."</p>

<p>"Yes. The dog would destroy all
evidence of his wolf ancestry. It has
been an enormous project, but the
people of the Nucleus have been at
it a long time. They have concocted
a consistent history which leaves out
all evidence of their predatory ancestry.
The items of reality which
were possible to leave have been
retained. The gaps between have been
bridged by fictionized accounts of
glorious undertakings and discoveries.
Most of the Markovian science
has been taken from other cultures,
but now their history boasts of heroes
and discoverers who never lived and
who were responsible for all the great
science they enjoy."</p>

<p>"But nothing stable can be built
upon such an unhealthy foundation
of self-deception!" Cameron protested.</p>

<p>"It is not unhealthy&mdash;not at the
present moment," said Venor. "The
time will come when it, too, will be
thrust aside and a tremendous effort
of scholarship will extract the elements
of truth and find that which
was suppressed. But the Markovians
themselves will do it&mdash;a generation
of them who can afford to laugh at
the fears and fantasies of their ancestors."</p>

<p>"This tells us nothing of how you
were able to make a creative people
out of a race of pirate marauders,"
said Cameron.</p>

<p>"I gave you the key," said Venor.
"It was one used long ago by your
own people before it was abandoned.</p>

<p>"How was the savage wolf tamed
to become the loyal, friendly dog?
Did ancient man try to exterminate
the wolves that came to his caves and
carried off his young? Perhaps he
tried. But he learned, perhaps accidentally,
another way of conquest. He
found the wolf's cubs, and learned
to love them. He brought the cubs
home and cared for them tenderly
and his own children played with
them and fed them and loved them.</p>

<p>"It took time, but eventually there
were no more wild wolves to trouble
man, because he had discovered a
great friend, the dog. And man plus
dog could handle wolf with ease.
Dog forgot in time what his forebears
were and became willing to defend
man against his own kind&mdash;because
man loved him.</p>

<p>"It happened again and again.
Agricultural man hated the wild
horse that ate his grain and trampled
his fields. But he learned to love the
horse, too, after a while. Again&mdash;no
more wild horses."</p>

<p>"But you can't take a predatory,
savage pirate and love him into decency!"
Cameron protested.</p>

<p>"No," Venor agreed. "It is too
difficult ordinarily at that level, and
wasteful of time and resources. But
I didn't say that is what happened.
You don't tame a wolf by loving it,
but the <i>cubs</i>&mdash;yes. And even pirates
have cubs, who are susceptible to being
loved.</p>

<p>"The first weapon was hate. But
after learning the futility of it,
sentient creatures discovered another,
the succeeding evolutionary emotion.
It is pure savagery in its destructive
power, a thousand times more effective
in annihilating the enemy.</p>

<p>"You've thought 'Love thy enemy'
was a soft, gentle, futile doctrine!
Actually, instead of merely killing
the enemy it twists his personality,
destroys his identity. He continues
to live, but he has lost his integrity
as an entity. The wolf cub never
becomes an adult wolf. He becomes
Dog.</p>

<p>"It is not a doctrine of weakness,
but the ultimate weapon of destruction.
It can be used to induce any
orientation desired in the mind of the
enemy. He'll do everything you want
him to&mdash;because he has your love."</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>"How did you apply that to the
Markovians?" asked Joyce in almost
a whisper.</p>

<p>"It was one of the most difficult
programs we have ever undertaken,"
said Venor. "There were comparatively
few of us and such a tremendous
population of Markovians. We
had predicted long ago, even before
the organization of the Council, the
situation would grow critical and
dangerous. By the time the Council
awoke to the fact and started its
futile debates we had made a strong
beginning.</p>

<p>"We arranged to be in the path
of a Markovian attack on one of the
worlds where our work was completed.
The Markovians were only
too happy to take us into slavery
and use us as victims in their brutal
sports."</p>

<p>"You didn't deliberately fall into
a trap where you allowed yourselves
to be killed and tortured by them?"
exclaimed Cameron.</p>

<p>Venor smiled. "The Markovians
thought we did. We could hardly
do that, of course. Our numbers were
so small compared with theirs that
we wouldn't have lasted very long.
And, obviously, it would have been
plain stupid. There is one key that
must not be forgotten: An effective
use of love requires an absolute superiority
on the levels attainable by
the individual to be tamed. So, in
this case, we had to have power to
keep the Markovians from slaughtering
us or we would have been unable
to accomplish our purpose.</p>

<p>"Teleportation is of obvious use
here. Likewise, psychosomatic controls
that can handle any ordinary
wound we might permit them to inflict.
We gave them the illusion of
slaughtering and torturing us, but our
numbers did not dwindle."</p>

<p>"Why did you give them such an
illusion?" Joyce asked. "And you
say you <i>permitted</i> them to inflict
wounds&mdash;?"</p>

<p>Venor nodded. "We were in their
households, you see, employed as
slaves and assigned the care of their
young. The cubs of the wolf were
given into our hands to love&mdash;and to
tame.</p>

<p>"These Markovian children were
witnesses to the supposed torture and
killing of those who loved them. It
was a tremendous psychic impact
and served to drive their influence
toward the side of the slaves. And
even the adults slowly recognized the
net loss to them of doing away with
servants so skilled and useful in
household tasks and caring for the
young. The games and brutality vanished
spontaneously within a short
time. Markovians, young and old,
simply didn't want them any longer.</p>

<p>"During the maturity of that first
generation of young on whom we
expended our love our position became
more secure. These were no
longer wolves. They had become
dogs, loyal to those who had loved
them, and we could use them now
against their own kind. Influences
to abandon piracy against other peoples
began to spread throughout the
Nucleus.</p>

<p>"Today the Markovians are no
longer a threat capable of holding the
Council worlds in helpless fear. They
long ago ceased their depredations.
Their internal stability is rising and
is almost at the point where we shall
be able to leave them. Our work
here is about finished."</p>

<p>"Surely all this was unnecessary!"
Joyce said. "With your powers of
teleportation and other psionic abilities
you must possess it should have
been easy for you to <i>control</i> the
Markovians directly, force them to
cease their piracy&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Of course," said Venor. "That
would have been so much easier for
us. And so futile. The Markovians
would have learned nothing through
being taken over by us and operated
externally. They would have remained
the same. But it was our desire
to change them, teach them, accomplish
genuine learning within them.
It is always longer and more difficult
this way. The results, however, are
more lasting!"</p>

<p>"<i>Who</i> are you people&mdash;<i>what</i> are
you?" Cameron said with sudden
intensity. "You have teleportation&mdash;and
how many other unknown psychic
powers? You have forced us to
believe you can tame such a vicious
world as the Markovian Nucleus once
was.</p>

<p>"But where is there a life of your
own? With all your powers you
must live at the whim of other cultures.
Where is <i>your</i> culture? Where
is your own purpose? In spite of all
you have, your life is a parasitical
one."</p>

<p>Venor smiled gently. "Is not the
parent&mdash;or the teacher&mdash;the servant
of the child?" he said. "Has it not
always been so if a species is to rise
very far in its conquest of the
Universe?</p>

<p>"But this does not mean that the
parent or teacher has no life of his
own. You ask where is our culture?
The culture of <i>all</i> worlds is ours. We
don't have great cities and vast fleets.
The wolf cubs build these for us.
They carry us across space and shelter
us in their cities.</p>

<p>"Our own energies are expended
in a thousand other and more profitable
ways. We have sought and learned
a few of the secrets of life and
mind. With these we can move as
you were moved, when we choose to
do so. From where I sit I can speak
with any of our kind on this planet
or any world of the entire Nucleus.
And a few of us, united in the effort,
can touch those in distant galaxies.</p>

<p>"What culture would you have us
acquire, that we do not have?" Venor
finished.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>Without answer, Cameron arose
and strode slowly to the window, his
back to the room. He looked out
upon the rude wooden huts and the
towering forest beyond. He tried to
tell himself it was all a lie. Such
things couldn't be. But he could feel
it now with increasing strength, as
if all his senses were quickening&mdash;the
benign aura, the indefinable wash
of power that seemed to lap at the
edge of his mind.</p>

<p>Out of the corner of his eye he
could see Joyce's face, almost radiant
as she, too, sensed it here in the
presence of the Ids.</p>

<p>Love, as a genuine power, had
been taught by every Terran philosopher
of any social worth. But it had
never really been tried. Not in the
way the Ids understood it. Cameron
felt he could only guess at the terrible
discipline of mind it required
to use it as they did. The analogy of
the wolf cubs was all very well, and
man had learned to go that far. But
there is a difference when your own
kind is involved, he thought.</p>

<p>Perhaps it was out of sheer fear
of each other that men continued to
try to sway with hate, the most
primitive of all their weapons.</p>

<p>It's easy to hate, he thought. Love
is hard, and because it is, the tough
humans who can't achieve it and have
the patience to manipulate it must
scorn it. The truly weak ones, they're
incapable of the stern and brutal
self-discipline required of one who
loves his enemy.</p>

<p>But men had known how. Back in
the caves they had known how to
conquer the wolf and the wild horse.
Where had they lost it?</p>

<p>The vision of the buildings and
the forest with its eternal peace was
still in his eyes. What else could you
want, with the whole Universe in the
palm of your hand?</p>

<p>He turned sharply. "You tricked
us into betraying ourselves to Marthasa,
and you said that you planned
it this way when you first heard of
our coming. But you have not yet
said why. Why did you want us to
see what you had done?"</p>

<p>"You needed to have evidence
from the Markovians themselves,"
said Venor. "That is why I led you
to the point where the admission
would be forced from them. The
problem you came to solve is now
answered, is it not? Is there anything
to prevent you returning to Earth
and writing a successful paper on
the mystery of the Markovians?"</p>

<p>"You know very well there is,"
said Cameron with the sudden sense
that Venor was laughing gently at
him. "Who on Earth would believe
what you have told me&mdash;that a handful
of meek, subservient Ids had
conquered the mighty Markovian
Nucleus?"</p>

<p>He paused, looking at Joyce who
returned his intense gaze.</p>

<p>"Is that all?" said Venor finally.</p>

<p>"No that is not all. After taking
us to the heights and showing us
everything that lies beyond, are you
simply going to turn us away empty-handed?"</p>

<p>"What would you have us give
you?"</p>

<p>"This," said Cameron, gesturing
with his hand to include the circle of
all of them, and the community beyond
the window. "We want what
you have discovered. Is your circle a
closed one&mdash;or can you admit those
who would learn of your ways but
are not of your race?"</p>

<p>Venor's smile broadened as he
arose and stepped toward them, and
they felt the warm wave of acceptance
from his mind even before he
spoke. "This is what we brought you
here to receive," he said. "But you
had to ask for yourselves. We wanted
men of Earth in our ranks. There
are many races and many worlds who
make up the Idealists. That is why it
is said that the Ids do not know the
home world from which they originally
came. It is true, they do not.
We are citizens of the Universe.</p>

<p>"But we have never been represented
by a native of Earth, which
needs us badly. Will you join us,
Terrans?"</p>
